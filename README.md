# Tale of Dagon

## Goals
- Add more map objects (furniture).
- Add shops to town.
- Add items to game.
- Sprite item objects.
- Move into SDL2
- Break out classes into seperate files.
- Move static data into files


## Cleanup and maintenance:
- Assets to fix build
- Graphic placeholders
- Figure out why my stack is overflowing
- Figure out why map generation is generating nothing but green land
- Figure out why the hell the license I copied and pasted from that royalty free music site's new-lines aren't rendering properly in markdown? I guess I need to figure out how markdown works.

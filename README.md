# Tale of Dagon

## Goals
- Add more map objects (furniture).
- Add shops to town.
    - Shop buildings added to towns.
    - Had tables rendering - missing in this build I guess?
- Add items to game.
- Sprite item objects.
- Move into SDL2
    - uhh maybe? but probably not? seems pretty far in, not sure migrating is a good idea.
- Break out classes into seperate files.
    - done
- Move static data into files

## Cleanup and maintenance:
- Figure out why my stack is overflowing
    - not figured out but fixed at least, related to assets
